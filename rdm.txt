# Ultrasound Object Detection

Project done in Electronic Laboratory in 1st year of Masters.

## Description

Implement an ultrasonic sensor in a robot, in order to make it detect obstacles that may arise along the way and make it deviate from them autonomously.

The project will be divided into several parts, starting with the assembly of the circuit on the white board, passing to the projection and design of the circuit in the Eagle software and the printing of the board is done to proceed with the soldering of the components.

## Job Done
